1) **Day 1**: Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
2) **Day 2**: Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i
             of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

3) **Day 3**: Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), 
             which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), 
             which deserializes the string back into the tree.
             
4) **Day 4**: Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

5) **Day 7**: Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message,
              count the number of ways it can be decoded.
             
6) **Day 447**: Implement the pow(x, y) function

7) **Day 6** : An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has an add(element) which adds the element to the end, and a get(index) which returns the node at index.
